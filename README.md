# Tour de France Analysis Project

This project explores stage-level performance data from the 2025 Tour de France.  
It includes data cleaning, SQL-based transformations, and visualization in Power BI.  

## 🔍 Goal

To analyze rider and team performance, detect trends across stage types, and simulate how different conditions affect results.

## 📁 Project structure

/data           → Cleaned CSVs  
/sql            → SQL transformations  
/reports        → Power BI dashboard screenshots  
README.md       → Project documentation  


## 🛠️ Technologies

- Power BI (visualizations, data modeling)
- Power Query (ETL)
- Microsoft Excel (Power Query, pivot tables)
- PostgreSQL (SQL querying and joins)
- Git & GitHub (version control, documentation)

## 📊 Sample questions

- Which riders are most consistent?
- How does stage type affect performance?
- Which teams dominate mountain stages?

## 🧠 Outcomes

- Built an incremental data pipeline
- Cleaned and modeled race data into facts and dimensions
- Created dynamic visualizations
- Gained end-to-end experience in a realistic data scenario
